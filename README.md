## 🚀 Tech Stack (aka the fun stuff)

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 with App Router ⚡ (because life's too short for slow websites)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 + custom animations 🎨 (making pixels dance since 2024)
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives 🧩 (accessible AND beautiful)
- **i18n:** next-intl 🇳🇴🇬🇧 (Norwegian/English - because why pick one?)
- **Blog:** MDX with gray-matter 📝 (markdown on steroids)
- **Deployment:** Vercel 🚢 (push to main and watch the magic happen)

## ✍️ Adding Blog Posts (when inspiration strikes)

Drop an `.mdx` file in `content/blog/{locale}/` with this simple frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Short description"
date: "2026-01-09"
---

Your brilliant thoughts here... 💭
```

## 🚀 Deployment (set it and forget it)

Every push to `main` triggers an automatic deployment to Vercel. It's like having a robot butler for your code! 🤖
